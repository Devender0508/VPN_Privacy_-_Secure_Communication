# üîê VPN Privacy & Secure Communication Report

## üìå Objective
To understand the role of **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** in protecting privacy, ensuring secure communication, and masking IP addresses.  

---

## üåç What is a VPN?
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a service that encrypts internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, hiding your real IP address and location.  

- It creates a secure ‚Äútunnel‚Äù between your device and the internet.  
- Prevents hackers, ISPs, and third parties from tracking your online activity.  
- Helps access geo-restricted content by masking your IP.

## ‚ö° Why Do We Use a VPN?
- To protect sensitive data while browsing, especially on public Wi-Fi.  
- To keep browsing history private from ISPs and advertisers.  
- To bypass censorship and access restricted websites.  
- To secure communication from cyber-attacks such as **man-in-the-middle attacks**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does a VPN Work?
1. The VPN client encrypts your data on your device.  
2. Encrypted traffic is sent to the VPN server.  
3. The server decrypts the data and forwards it to the destination website.  
4. The website sees the VPN server‚Äôs IP address, not your real IP.  
5. The response follows the same encrypted tunnel back to you.
